# PillTracker

Inspiration

It is always a problem to remember to take pills on time, so we need a better way to track pill taking.

## What it does

The user can input the number of times he has to take the medicine and also provide safe intervals for each time he has to take these pills. Subsequently, every time ou take a pill you should press the button. This will send a request to the cloud to store data. Then, we check in regular intervals whether there is an interval and provide messages to the user about his/her pill taking.

## How we build it

We built it using Node.js and AXA wireless button

## What's next for Pill Tracker
